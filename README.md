# Real-Estate-Project
My dossier project for the IB Computer Science HL exam. This program helps developers manage their portfolio with tools to display and calculate data, document tasks and problems, and comment with other developers.  

All of my documentation is attached! I have also uploaded direct access to the UML for this project.

Run the GUI.java file to access the GUI window and run the program. If running for the first time on a new computer, note that the listOfProjectsRAF.txt file must be properly cleared so the program doensn't look for nonexistant projects. Other nuances like this are covered more extensivly in the documentation.
